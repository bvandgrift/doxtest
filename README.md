# Doxygen Structural Test

## A Documentation Exemplar

This project should provide examples for all
python-related cases in Doxygen. The primary
goal is to note when to use which type of comment,
whether:

```python
    ## @thing stuff
    # extra stuff
    def function_name(args):
        pass
```

or

```python
    def function_name(args):
        """ @thing stuff
        extra stuff
        """
        pass
```
